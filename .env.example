# Optional: comma-separated list of guild IDs for instant (per-guild) command registration.
# If left empty, commands will be registered globally (may take up to ~1 hour to propagate).
# Example:
# GUILD_IDS=123456789012345678,987654321098765432

# Optional: set to 'true' to attempt a one-time manual registration of a test ping command on startup.
# Useful when debugging registration issues. Manual registrations are done via the REST API and require
# the bot to be in the target guild(s).
# MANUAL_REGISTER=true

# Optional: set to 'true' to deploy commands from Sapphire's command store (default: false).
# By default, this project uses the manual file loader to reliably import TypeScript command files
# when running via ts-node. Enable this only if you want to use Sapphire's piece system for deployment.
